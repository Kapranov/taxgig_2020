# Chat

This is the chat server built in Elixir with the goal to show a
real life application of Websockets.

**TODO: Add description**

![the sketch](sketch.png?raw=true)

## Features roadmap

- As a client I want to create a user so that I can use the chat system
- As a user I can send a private message to an existing user to that I
  can talk directly without using an existing room

## How to use the chat

The web client will be available at `http://localhost:4000/chat.html`
or `https://localhost:4001/chat.html`

## Scratchpad

```
bash> mix new chat --sup
```
